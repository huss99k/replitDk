For you to do:

(all output should be one per line)

- On line 6, write a print statement that prints out a substring of str starting at index 5 and going to the end
- On line 7, write a print statement that prints out a substring of str starting at index 7 and ending at index 10
- On line 10, fill in the () in substring so that it prints "harambe"
- On line 11, fill in the () in substring so that it prints "t f"
