Create 4 overloaded methods called printArray:

 1. accepts a single dimensional integer array and prints its contents in a single line with a space
      {1,2,3,4,5} -> 1 2 3 4 5

 2. accepts a single dimensional character array and prints its contents in a single line without a space
      {'h','e','l','l','o'} -> hello

 3. accepts a 2 dimensional String array and prints its contents as a matrix
     { {"hey","what's","up"},   
       {"hola","que","hondas"},    
       {"como","te","vas"},        
       {"how","do","you", "do"}    
     }
       hey what's up
       hola que hondas
       como te vas
       how do you do

 4. accepts a 3 dimensional long array and prints its contents as a matrix
    {
      { {21,3,4,5},{11,33,44,22} },
      { {1,1,1},{2,1,2}, {3,1} },
      { {9,6},{5,5,5,5}, {99,4,21,11} },
    }
        21 3 4 5 11 33 44 22 
        1 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 
        9 6 5 5 5 5 99 4 21 11
