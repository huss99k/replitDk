/* Write a program that prints the following line of
* output 1000 times:
*
* 
*
* Make sure to use multiple methods to achieve the result (for example, create a method called ten() that prints out the * above sentence 10 times, and call this method in another method called hundered() 10 times, and then call hundred()       method in another method called thousand() 10 times.  That way you could write only a single method call in main         method, thousand(), to print out the sentence 1000 times)
