An ArrayList is a collection of objects, similar to an array.  However, a few notable differences in how they work:

- The size of an ArrayList can be changed
- You can add, insert, and delete elements easily with ArrayLists
- You can only have ArrayLists of objects!  
- Unlike arrays, ArrayLists need to be imported before they can be used.  



Implement the test method that declares and initializes an empty ArrayList of Integers, then returns it.
