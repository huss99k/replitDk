 Given the following inputs:

```
int x;
```

Write a for loop that will print out a series of numbers starting at 0 and ending before x, skipping 3 each time (excluding x).


Sample input/outputs:

```
In: 7
0 3 6
```

```
In: 12
0 3 6 9
```

```
In: 20
0 3 6 9 12 15 18
```

HINT: You'll want to change the increment part of the for loop!
