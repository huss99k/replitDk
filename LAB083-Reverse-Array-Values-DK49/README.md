Reversing the values of an array involves swapping the corresponding values of the array from both ends: the first with the last, the second with the next to the last, and so on, all the way to the middle of the array.

Create a method that takes a char array and reverses its element values and prints out the array contents using Arrays.toString().
  
  Examples:
   reverse(new char[] {'a', 'b', 'c'}) -> [c, b, a]
   reverse(new char[] {'c', 'i', 'v', 'i', 'c'}) -> [c, i, v, i, c]
   reverse(new char[] {'j', 'a', 'v', 'a'}) -> [a, v, a, j]
   reverse(new char[] {'y', 'o'}) -> [o, y]
   reverse(new char[] {'o'}) -> [o]
