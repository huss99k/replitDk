  First method should genearte a random String of 5 lowercase charcters

  Second method should accept the length of the string as parameter and  genearte a random String of lowercase charcters of given length
  
  Third method should accept the length of the string and boolean parameter called isUppercase  and  genearte a random String of uppercase charcters of given length if the boolean value is true, otherwise geneartes all lowercase

  Once you create all 3 methods, test them in the main method by passing corresponding arguments.
