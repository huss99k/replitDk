Complete the sumEvenIndex method so that it takes in a 2-dimensional integer array and sums all numbers that are in an even index or an even row.

For example, in the following array, the numbers with parentheses would be summed:

```
     0  1  2  3
```

```
0   (4)(6)(3)(2)
```

```
1   (4) 1 (2) 3
```

```
2   (1)(2)(6)(9)
```
