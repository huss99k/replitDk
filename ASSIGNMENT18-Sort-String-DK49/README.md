Given a string, return its version where the characters are in sorted order. 
You are not allowed to use any built-in methods such as Arrays.sort(). You can also assume the String will be composed of lowercase alphabetic characters.
   Examples:
   javascript -> aacijprstv
   algorithm -> aghilmort
   barack -> aabckr
   stamlo -> almost
