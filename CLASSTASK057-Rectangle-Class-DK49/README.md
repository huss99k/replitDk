Design a class named Rectangle to represent a rectangle.
 
The class contains:

■ Two double data fields(instance variables) named width and height that specify the width and height of the rectangle. 
  The default values are 1 for both width and height.
■ A no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle.
■ A method named getArea() that returns the area of this rectangle.
■ A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter.

Test your class in the main method by creating two Rectangle objects—one with width 4 and height 40 and the other with width 3.5 and height 35.9. 
Display the width, height, area, and perimeter of each rectangle.
