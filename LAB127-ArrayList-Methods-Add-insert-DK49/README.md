Given an ArrayList of Strings called words, insert the String "yo" in between each String element. Assume the passed ArrayList will have at least 2 elements.
 
 Examples:
    [hello, hi, what, who] -> [hello, yo, hi, yo, what, yo, who]

    [hello, what, who] -> [hello, yo, what, yo, who]

    [hello, what] -> [hello, yo, what]
