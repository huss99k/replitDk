Create a program in the main method that simulates the ATM machine.
Your program should ask the user to enter the pin number. You can assume the pin number is 1441.
It should display an error message continuously if the pin is entered incorrectly.
When the pin is entered correctly, it should display the welcome message.

Use do-while loop.


EXTRA: add an option to lock the account and end the program after 3 tries.
If the user enters the pin wrong 3 times then you should
 display a message "You entered wrong pin 3 times, your account is locked. Contact customer service."

Sample output:
  
     
      
       // Welcome to DuoBANK. 
         
        //Please enter your pin.
       // 1223
       // Please enter your pin:
       // 1222
       // Please enter your pin::
       // 1441

       // You entered the correct pin. Welcome to your account.!

EXTRA:

       // 1222
