1. Complete the Dog.java class:

Include the following instance variables:

* name

* breed

* weight


Write two constructors:

* The no-arg constructor with empty body

* A secondary constructor that accepts only name and weight (breed defaults to "Mutt")

2. Test your code with the Main.java class:

Create a Dog object using both Constructors and print their fields to make sure it's correct.
