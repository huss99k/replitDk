Create 3 overloaded methods called getArea to calculate the areas of the following geometric shapes:

 1. calculates and returns the area of a circle based on the radius. The formula: Area = p * r^2 where p is PI and r is radius. (r^2 -> r squared)
 2. calculates and returns the area of a rectangle based on the width and height. The formula: Area = width * height.
 3. calculates and returns the area of a cylinder based on the radius and height. Area = 2 * p * r^2 * h where p is PI and r is radius, h is height.
