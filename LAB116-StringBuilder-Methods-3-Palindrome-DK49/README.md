Create a method that checks if a String is a palindrome. Punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored in this case. Use StringBuilder class methods to implement the method.

  Examples:
   Able was I ere I saw Elba -> true
   A man, a plan, a canal â€“ Panama -> true
   Madam, I'm Adam -> true
   Mr. Owl ate my metal worm -> true
   Do geese see God? -> true
   Was it a car or a cat I saw? -> true
   Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog -> true
   Show me the code -> false
