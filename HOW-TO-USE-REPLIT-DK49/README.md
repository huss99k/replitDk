HOW TO USE THIS PLATFORM:

Instructions for each assignment will be in README.md file.

All your code should be written in Main.java file. You should not rename the class name, otherwise your code will not run.

Once you are done with your code or while working on your assignment, you can execute your code by clicking Run button on the top, which will run your code on the console and display the output.

The console is similar to the console of the IDE where you can enter inputs and see the output.

Once you run your code and verify that everything is okay, you can use the provided tests, if there are any, to check your answer.
 
Tests can be unit tests, input/output tests or pre-written code in the main method.

Your code needs to pass all given test cases.

Once all tests pass and you are done with your assignment, click on submit button on the top right for submission.

You can submit your code even if you don't have the correct solution, but make sure to add specific comments about specific lines, and specific challenges. The instructor will be able to also comment on your code and suggest fixes. Once you fix the issues, you can re-submit your assignment again for evaluation.
