Complete the diffHiLo method.  The method takes in a 2-D integer array and returns the difference between the highest element in the array and the lowest.  The result should always be a positive number.

Use the following to find absolute value:

```
Math.abs(-1) ==> 1
```

```
Math.abs(6) ==> 6
```

```
Math.abs(-5) ==> 5
```
