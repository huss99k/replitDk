A number is "teen" if it is in the range 13..19 inclusive. 
Given 3 int values, return true if 1 or more of them are teen.

Examples:
  hasTeen(13, 20, 10) → true
  hasTeen(20, 19, 10) → true
  hasTeen(20, 10, 13) → true



A method header is already defined for you. You need to provide the implementation.
