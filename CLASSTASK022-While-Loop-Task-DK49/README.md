Your method should print out the given String int amount of times;

printMessage("Hello" , 5 ) -> prints Hello 5 times
printMessage("Hello" , 1000 ) -> prints Hello 1000 times
printMessage("Welcome to VA" , 500 ) -> prints Welcome to VA 500 times
printMessage("Loops are powerful" , 25 ) -> prints Loops are powerful 25 times

Use a while loop to achieve the task purpose.
