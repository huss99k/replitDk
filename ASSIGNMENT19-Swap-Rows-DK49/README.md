 Create a method that takes a 2D array of ints, and swaps the row with the minimum sum with the first row and returns that array.

 Example:

 Given:

     {1,2,3}
     {4,5,6}   
     {1,0,1} // row with min sum   
   

  Returns:
     {1,0,1} // swapped with the first row values
     {4,5,6}    
     {1,2,3}    
   


Example 2:

Given:

{6, 7, 9, 4, 8}   
{3, 2, 7, 4, 1}
{9, 4, 5, 8, 9}


Returns:

{9, 4, 5, 8, 9}
{3, 2, 7, 4, 1}
{6, 7, 9, 4, 8}
