Generating and using a random mock data is common in testing.
 
Create a static method getRandomSSN() in the given Utilities class that generates a random SSN and prints in "XXX-XX-XXXX" format.

Call your method in main method to verify your output.

Examples:
 
 getRandomSSN() -> 123-53-3121
 getRandomSSN() -> 956-99-4209

(Extra: Adjust your code so that your method can also print such values as 001-00-0101)
