Create a program that changes a given amount of money into smaller monetary units.

The program lets the user enter an amount as a double value representing a total in dollars and cents (e.g. 23.89) and prints out  a report listing the monetary equivalent in the maximum number of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, in this order, to result in the minimum number of coins.

Hint: First convert the amount into cents (23.89 -> 2389) then from that number extract dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies (in that order) using division (/) and modulo (%) operator.

Example input and output:
--------------------------------  
   Please enter the amount:
   23.89
   Your amount 23.89 consists of:
   23 dollars
   3 quarters
   1 dimes
   0 nickels
   4 pennies
