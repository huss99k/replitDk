Create a program that gets input from the user as an integer number between 1-999 (1 and 999 included) and calculates the sum of the digits of the entered number. (The code for getting the input has already been written for you)

For example, if the entered number is 473, it should display 14 as a result  (4+7+3=14).

If the entered number is 67, it should display 13 as a result(6+7=13).

If the entered number is 5, it should display 5 as a result.

Use division (/) and modulo (%) operators to achieve the result.

(hint: % 10  will get you the last digit of a number: 456 % 10 -> 6
      / 10   will get rid of last the digit of a number: 456 / 10 -> 45)

Your program should work correctly with numbers in the range 1-999.

Your program should only print out only one value (sum of digits) at the end, nothing else.

Console output example 1:

  Enter a number between 1-999:
  234
  9

Console output example 2:

  Enter a number between 1-999:
  589
  22

Console output example 3:

  Enter a number between 1-999:
  782
  17
