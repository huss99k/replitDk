Create a method that takes 2 integers that represent the range of numbers and returns the sum of the even numbers within that range. You can assume that first parameter is less than or equal to second parameter.


sumOfEven(1,10) -> 30  (2+4+6+8+10)
sumOfEven(2,12) -> 42  (2+4+6+8+10+12)
sumOfEven(1,100) -> 2450  (2+4+6+...+96+98+100)

sumOfEven(95,105) -> (96+98+100+102+104)



Use for loop to accumulate and achieve the result.
