 1. Complete the Car.java class:

Include the following instance variables:

* make

* model

* numberOfDoors

* topSpeed

* price



Write four constructors:

* The no-arg constructor with empty body

* A constructor that does not include numberOfDoors, which should default to 4

* A constructor that does not include make or model; both default to "unknown"

* A constructor that does not include topSpeed or price; default to 90 and 0 respectively.

2. Test your code with the Main.java class:

Create several Car objects using all Constructors and print their fields to make sure it's correct.
