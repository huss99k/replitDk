Complete the method so that it takes in a 2-D array and returns the sums of the rows as an integer array.

For example, the if we run rowSums for the following 2D array:

```
{
```

```
  {1,1,2}, //sum = 4
```

```
  {3,1,2}, //sum = 6
```

```
  {3,5,3}, //sum = 11
```

```
  {0,1,2}  //sum = 3
```

```
}
```

Then we should get the following array back:

```
{4,6,11,3}
```
