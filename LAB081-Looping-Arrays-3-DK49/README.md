Create a method called timesTen that takes each element of given int array and multiply its value by 10 and prints
the array content afterwards. 
Use for loop or Arrays.toString() method to print out the array content.
  

   Examples:
    timesTen(new int[] {1,2,3}); -> [10,20,30]
    timesTen(new int[] {0,10,100,1000}); -> [0,100,1000,10000]
    timesTen(new int[] {1,2,3}); -> [10,20,30]
    timesTen(new int[] {7}); -> [70]
    timesTen(new int[] {1,1}); -> [10,10]
