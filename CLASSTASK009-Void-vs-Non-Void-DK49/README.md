Create 2 methods that perform the following similar task:

1st method needs to take 2 Strings called firstName, lastName and and print out
the full name in reverse order -> 
Example method call;
("Joe", "Biden") -> Biden, Joe

2nd method needs to do the same exact thing as the 1st method except it returns the generated reverse full name
instead of printing out;
