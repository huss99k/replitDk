Create a method called combineNames that accepts 2 String arrays and returns a new String array that is composed of the combination of each element of each given array. You can assume two array lengths will be equal.

Examples: 

{"bob","joe","rob"} , {"jones","smith","paul} -> [bob jones, joe smith, rob paul]
{"Barack","Kamala"} ,  {"Obama","Harris"} -> ["Barack Obama", "Kamala Harris"]
{"Hey","What's up"} , {"Yo","Man"} -> ["Hey Yo", "What's up Man "]
