Implement the method that takes an ArrayList of Integers.

This method should:

- Create a new ArrayList of Integers
- Add only the positive Integers to the new ArrayList
- Sum the positive Integers in the new ArrayList and add the Sum as the last element

For example, if the passed ArrayList contains the Integers (4, -6, 3, -8, -1, 4, 3), the ArrayList that gets returned should be (4,3,4,3,14), with 14 being the sum of (4,3,4,3).  The original ArrayList should remain unchanged.
