 You are given two inputs:

```
int num1;
int num2;
```

You can assume that the following:

```
num2 > num1 ==> TRUE
```

You are to write a program that will calculate and print out the **SUM OF ODD** numbers in between num1 and num2 inclusive.  Your output should all be on one line, separated by spaces.
Sample input/output:

```
#1: 3
#2: 11
35
```

```
#1: 4
#2: 20
96
```

```
#1: -2
#2: 6
8
```
