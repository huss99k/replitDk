Write a program that prints 6 random character sequence of upper and lowercase chars. Use ASCII table for their range.
The case of the characters should vary with each char. 
The order must be -> lowercase,uppercase,lowercase,uppercase,lowercase,uppercase.

Your program should have only ONE output and it should vary with each run since the characters generated will be random. 
Your output should have only the characters and nothing else, otherwise tests will fail.

Below are some examples of a possible console output:

Example 1
-------------------------------------
dJrSaH


Example 2
-------------------------------------
xYyOtL


Example 3
